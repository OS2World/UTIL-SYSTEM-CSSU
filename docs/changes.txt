Known problems:                         

- System name parsing is not waterproof (might get System Name:User instead)
- almost no error checking!

To-Do-List:

- Add a console to enter commands
- Make timer configurable
- Support for firmware updates (do not expect that too soon)
- use RxExtras only when available
- do some error checking (almost completely missing)
- help & docs
